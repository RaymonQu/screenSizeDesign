<!--I accomplished this task by using the @media screen css options
which allow me to use css differently if the screen size is different. I
made the background yellow if the width was below 600(with max-width) and
made the bacground lightblue if it was 601 or above(with min-width). The main
thing that makes the same webpage look different at different sizes is this CSS, 
the CSS that changes the way things look based off of screen size.-->
